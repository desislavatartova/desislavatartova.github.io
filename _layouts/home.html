    <p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
This paper studies how uniform increases in teacher wages affect the average quality of the teaching workforce. I exploit a 2014 French reform that substantially increased wages in highly disadvantaged schools but only modestly in slightly less disadvantaged ones to identify the heterogeneous exit elasticities with respect to wages across teachers of different productivity levels. I show that high-productivity teachers - defined using plausibly unbiased measures of teacher value-added - are three times more responsive to wage increases in their exit decisions than low-productivity teachers. I develop a simple labor-supply framework showing that high-productivity teachers are more responsive to wages because their preferences between teaching and the outside option are less dispersed and, on average, closer to the indifference threshold. I find empirical support for a mechanism that can rationalize the latter: teachers with better average outside options have more incentives to collect information about them, thus reducing the dispersion in their relative preferences. Finally, policy counterfactuals show that while uniform wage increases raise aggregate teacher quality, given the differential elasticities, targeting increases toward high-productivity teachers delivers larger gains at lower fiscal cost.

<b>Teacher Value-Added in the Absence of Annual Test Scores: Utilizing Teacher Networks</b>
		    </a></p>
    <p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4395082" target="_blank">[SSRN]</a> <p>
	<p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> 
This paper proposes a novel methodology for estimating teacher value-added in the presence of non-random teacher-student sorting and the absence of annual standardized student test scores. Rather than relying on lagged student test scores to control for 
nonrandom teacher-student sorting on student ability, I exploit within-student across-subject variation in test scores and teacher "networks" - teachers in the same subject who teach groups of students observed with a unique teacher in another subject.  
The resulting estimates closely recover the true parameters of teacher value-added in Monte Carlo simulations and align well with estimates from standard methodologies in New York City data where lagged test scores are available. 
		The methodology substantially expands the research on teacher value-added, as the majority of educational settings do not rely on standardized testing in consecutive grade levels. 
		I apply the method to French middle school teachers and find that a 1 SD increase in teacher value-added within school improves student scores by 0.10 SD in Math and 0.07 SD in French. 
		I show that using a "hybrid" methodology - which augments the network estimator to control for lagged scores - in settings where lagged scores are available can outperform standard methods under specific sorting patterns by accounting for sorting on time-varying student unobservables.
