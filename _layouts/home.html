<b>Teacher Value-Added in the Absence of Annual Test Scores: Utilising Teacher Networks</b>
		    </a></p>

	<p align="justify"> <u><em>Abstract:</em></u> I develop a novel method for estimating teacher value added which controls for non-random student-teacher sorting without having to control for lagged grades in standardised tests. To do so, I exploit "networks" of teachers  - teachers from the same subject who are observed in classrooms with a unique "link" teacher from another subject. I measure the relative value added of two teachers in a network as the difference between their classrooms' grades in a standardised exam, unexplained by student characteristics, correcting for the classrooms' grade differential in the subject of the link teacher. I show that the estimated teacher effects are unbiased under plausible assumptions that I confirm in the data. Using exhaustive French administrative data, I find that a 1 SD increase in  teacher value added within school improves student scores by 0.17 SD in Math and 0.16 SD in French.
